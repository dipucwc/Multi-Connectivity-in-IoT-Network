# Multi-Connectivity-in-IoT-Network
Choosing a wide variety of use cases, single wireless standard cannot adequately prevail. Choosing the right wireless connectivity technology for an IoT (Internet of Things) application can be quit challenging. In this regards, strong multi connectivity via coordinated multi point communication with reliability can be a fruitful solution. Nodes play a vital role in case of communicating with a centralized `cloud` in a secure manner to protect, store and process data. If one node is failure to work, then another node can work which leads to get continuous connection. This project work represents regarding measuring connectivity by changing parameters like radius, distance, capacity and power of nodes.
